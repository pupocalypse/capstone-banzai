### A digital tool for building and referencing character sheets for the table-top role-playing game, Legend of the Five Rings.

Hello TAs!

I pushed very hard to get a lot of functionality through for this submission, but the most important feature that is currently lacking is that the data in the wizard is not submitted to the server to actually create a character sheet yet (the existing one for Hayami is currently hard-coded). This is, of course, something I will be working at before demo day.

Thank you for everything! <3
