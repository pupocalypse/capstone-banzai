The lessons taught by their sensei are essential to fulfilling their duties as warriors inside the Shadowlands. Those who do not heed their teachers well do not survive to perpetuate their mistakes. Those who excel at their lessons become a scourge upon the Shadowlands, moving through that dark realm with speed and grace, leaving death in their wake.\nThe Hiruma Bushi School emphasizes movement and survival, not just to endure a strike as the Hida do, but to live through an entire skirmish. In one-on-one combat the Hiruma excels at evading his opponent, while in larger skirmishes his ability to avoid damage makes him adept at reaching trouble-some foes and eliminating them while his allies tie up other rank-and-file opponents.","skills":{"core":[["athletics",1],["hunting",1],["kenjutsu",1],["kyujutsu",1],["lore: shadowlands",1],["stealth",1]],"emphases":[{"skillName":"kenjutsu","emphasis":"katana"}],"freePickType":[["any"]]},"honor":4.5,"outfit":{"armor":{"option1":"ashigaru armor","option2":"light armor"},"clothing":"sturdy clothing","weapons":{"base":{"base1":"katana","base2":"wakizashi"},"options":{"option1":["bow","20 arrows"],"option2":"knife"}},"tools":[""],"pack":"traveling pack","koku":3}},"totalExp":"40","currentExp":"39","rings":{"air":{"traits":{"reflexes":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"awareness":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}},"rank":null},"earth":{"traits":{"stamina":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"willpower":{"rank":3,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"fire":{"traits":{"agility":{"rank":3,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"intelligence":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"water":{"traits":{"strength":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"perception":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}},"rank":null},"void":{"traits":{"void":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":true}},"rank":null}},"skills":{"athletics":{"trait":"strength","type":"Bugei","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"hunting":{"trait":"perception","type":"Bugei","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"kenjutsu":{"trait":"agility","type":"Bugei","subType":["Weapon"],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"kyujutsu":{"trait":"reflexes","type":"Bugei","subType":["Weapon"],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"lore: shadowlands":{"trait":"intelligence","type":"Low","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"stealth":{"trait":"agility","type":"Low","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"commerce":{"trait":"intelligence","type":"Merchant","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1}}},{"id":"f5067ba07e40","timestamp":1601246255000,"artwork":"","firstName":"","lastName":"","job":"","clan":"","family":{},"school":{},"totalExp":"40","currentExp":"39","rings":{"air":{"traits":{"reflexes":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"awareness":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"earth":{"traits":{"stamina":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"willpower":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"fire":{"traits":{"agility":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"intelligence":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"water":{"traits":{"strength":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"perception":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"void":{"traits":{"void":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":true}}}},"skills":{}},{"id":"dfaa49170017","timestamp":1601246727000,"artwork":"","firstName":"","lastName":"","job":"","clan":"","family":{},"school":{},"totalExp":"40","currentExp":"39","rings":{"air":{"traits":{"reflexes":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"awareness":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"earth":{"traits":{"stamina":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"willpower":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"fire":{"traits":{"agility":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"intelligence":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"water":{"traits":{"strength":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"perception":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"void":{"traits":{"void":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":true}}}},"skills":{}},{"id":"aa67423ed1da","timestamp":1601246750000,"artwork":"","firstName":"","lastName":"Mirumoto","job":"bushi","clan":"Dragon","family":{"name":"Mirumoto","bonus":"agility","description":"The Mirumoto are the broad shoulders that carry the burdens of the Dragon Clan.

This is a controversial style because it flies in the face of the traditional style used by the other clans for centuries, although Niten was actually developed at the same time as the one-sword style. In particular, the rivalry between students of the Mirumoto Bushi School and the Kakita Bushi School, the greatest advocates of Kakita’s “One soul, one sword” philosophy, is heated even during times of peace. Many opponents, anticipating the reputation of the Dragon as erratic, are surprised to face the calm, implacable Mirumoto as an enemy, a mistake that has cost more than one samurai victory on the field of battle.\nThe Mirumoto Bushi School focuses on the mechanical benefits of wielding two weapons simultaneously, both in forgiving the penalties associated with doing so and improv-ing the benefits. It also increases the samurai’s Armor TN and grants him additional attacks at an increased rate due to the availability of his weapons.","skills":{"core":[["defense",1],["iaijutsu",1],["kenjutsu",1],["lore: shugenja",1],["lore: theology",1],["meditation",1]],"emphases":[{"skillName":"kenjutsu","emphasis":"katana"}],"freePickType":[["bugei","high"]]},"honor":4.5,"outfit":{"armor":{"option1":"light armor","option2":""},"clothing":"sturdy clothing","weapons":{"base":{"base1":"katana","base2":"wakizashi"},"options":{"option1":"any","option2":""}},"tools":[""],"pack":"traveling pack","koku":5}},"totalExp":"40","currentExp":"39","rings":{"air":{"traits":{"reflexes":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"awareness":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}},"rank":null},"earth":{"traits":{"stamina":{"rank":3,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"willpower":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"fire":{"traits":{"agility":{"rank":3,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"intelligence":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"water":{"traits":{"strength":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"perception":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}},"rank":null},"void":{"traits":{"void":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":true}},"rank":null}},"skills":{"defense":{"trait":"reflexes","type":"Bugei","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"iaijutsu":{"trait":"reflexes","type":"Bugei","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"kenjutsu":{"trait":"agility","type":"Bugei","subType":["Weapon"],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"lore: shugenja":{"trait":"intelligence","type":"High","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"lore: theology":{"trait":"intelligence","type":"High","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"meditation":{"trait":"void","type":"High","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"battle":{"trait":"perception","type":"Bugei","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1}}},{"id":"36b9aa54c48f","timestamp":1601246855000,"artwork":"","firstName":"","lastName":"Doji","job":"bushi","clan":"Crane","family":{"name":"Doji","bonus":"awareness","description":"Lords of the Crane Clan, the Doji are the unquestioned masters of culture and politics in the Empire.

The School focuses unapologetically upon dueling. Other skills are part of the core teachings, but they are considered incidental and in many cases are offered only because some facet of their instruction relates in some way to iaijutsu. While there are those in the Empire who have criticized the School for its narrow focus, few can argue with the results; many battles have been won by the Crane because an enemy general was slain in a duel before the fighting began. Likewise the Crane stranglehold on the courts is easier to maintain when any challenge can be answered by a Kakita champion taking the courtier’s place in a duel.\nThe Kakita Techniques place an obvious emphasis on iaijutsu but several of them can be of use in both dueling and general skirmishing. The Kakita are generally faster than most opponents, reflected in their Initiative bonuses, and are able to utilize the Center Stance for greater benefits than normal, both in dueling and outside.","skills":{"core":[["etiquette",1],["iaijutsu",1],["kenjutsu",1],["kyujutsu",1],["sincerity",1],["tea ceremony",1]],"emphases":[{"skillName":"iaijutsu","emphasis":"focus"}],"freePickType":[["bugei","high"]]},"honor":6.5,"outfit":{"armor":{"option1":"light armor","option2":""},"clothing":"sturdy clothing","weapons":{"base":{"base1":"katana","base2":"wakizashi"},"options":{"option1":"any","option2":""}},"tools":[""],"pack":"traveling pack","koku":10}},"totalExp":"40","currentExp":"39","rings":{"air":{"traits":{"reflexes":{"rank":3,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"awareness":{"rank":3,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}}},"earth":{"traits":{"stamina":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"willpower":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}},"rank":null},"fire":{"traits":{"agility":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"intelligence":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}},"rank":null},"water":{"traits":{"strength":{"rank":2,"type":"physical","isVoid":false},"perception":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":false}},"rank":null},"void":{"traits":{"void":{"rank":2,"type":"mental","isVoid":true}},"rank":null}},"skills":{"etiquette":{"trait":"awareness","type":"High","subType":["Social"],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"iaijutsu":{"trait":"reflexes","type":"Bugei","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"kenjutsu":{"trait":"agility","type":"Bugei","subType":["Weapon"],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"kyujutsu":{"trait":"reflexes","type":"Bugei","subType":["Weapon"],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"sincerity":{"trait":"awareness","type":"High","subType":["Social"],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"tea ceremony":{"trait":"void","type":"High","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"hunting":{"trait":"perception","type":"Bugei","subType":[],"schoolSkill":true,"rank":1},"battle":{"trait":"perception","type":"Bugei","subType":[],"schoolSkill":false,"rank":1}}},{"id":"13c606f866b7","timestamp":1601247169000,"artwork":"","firstName":"","lastName":"Shosuro","job":"bushi","clan":"Scorpion","family":{"name":"Shosuro","bonus":"awareness","description":"The Shosuro dwell in shadows, rarely being seen but always having an influence on those around them.
