## 万歳 Banzai!

### A digital tool for building and referencing character sheets for the table-top role-playing game, Legend of the Five Rings.

_Please note that **Banzai!** is an ambitious project! As such, it is currently in progress and will take some time to integrate a good chunk of the core rules. **Banzai!** also is a fan-made project with no claims to the intellectual property. :)_

_Banzai!_ utilizes rules from the 4th edition of L5R, a set of books which is unfortunately out of print. The application will provide helpful tooltips and information, to a reasonable degree, in the interest of beginners. If you are interested in the current 5th edition of the game by Fantasy Flight Games, you can learn more [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/legend-of-the-five-rings-roleplaying-game/)

##### To learn more about the lore of the game, there are a couple of wikis available:

- [L5R Fandom Wiki](https://l5r.fandom.com/wiki/Legend_of_the_Five_Rings_Wiki)
- [The Last Haiku Wiki](http://lasthaiku.wikidot.com/start)

#### Stay tuned for further updates!
